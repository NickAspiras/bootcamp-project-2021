      <h2> Teriyaki Chicken Recipe </h2>
      <p>
        This recipe of Teriyaki Chicken is a recipe from my father and grandfather. This is a 8-12 hour marinated teryaki chicken recipe, in which was passed down in a special way.
        I was only told the ingredients in the recipe and not the increments of each ingredient, something I was to find out for myself.
